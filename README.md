# OpenSecurityAPIs
A repository to document Information Security APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger 3

Short Term TODO:
* explore using a CICD tool to validate these APIs are working as intended (Travis, jx, or circleCI) (how do we do secrets management?)
* gather community wish list for supported APIs
* ask for help from community and vendors


A list of APIs that we'd like to support (please add your wishlist):
* Censys
* Shodan
* SocialNet
* End Game
* Carbon Black
* Cylance
* Crowdstrike Falcon
* Fire Eye
* MISP
* YETI
* TheHive
* ThreatConnect
* Recorded Future
