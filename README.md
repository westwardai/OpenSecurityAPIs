# OpenSecurityAPIs
A repository to document Information Security APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger 3

Short Term TODO:
* explore using a CICD tool to validate these APIs are working as intended (Travis, jx, or circleCI) (how do we do secrets management?)
* gather community wish list for supported APIs
* ask for help from community and vendors
* figure out how to map API endpoints to [OSSEM](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM) [Common Information Model](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/tree/master/common_information_model)
* build enrichment server automatically e.g.: /enrich/ip, /enchrich/ip/virustotal, /enrich/ip/passivetotal etc.
* migrate this repo away from a company github organization
